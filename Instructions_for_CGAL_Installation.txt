CGAL INSTALLATION FOR UBUNTU SYSTEMS

The folder has a shell script named "CGALInstall.sh" (Paste the file in the folder where CGAL files and demos are to be copied).
The script installs CGAL(Computational Geometry Algorithms Library) and other required libraries like OpenGL, Boost, QT4, QGLViewer etc.
Run the shell script as (in the terminal)
                                            $sh CGALInstall.sh

The above script should install CGAL and its dependencies.

To check whether the installation has been done perfectly try running a demo program with the following commands:

  cd CGAL-4.6.3 #enters the CGAL folder
  cd demo #enter the folder with demo programs
  cd Triangulation_3
  cmake .
  make
  ./T3_demo

This should open a graphical window.

If the graphical window appears, CGAL and all its dependencies have been installed correctly.
If not, some errors have occurred during the installation process.

NOTE: During the installation process the root user password is required.
User confirmation will also be required for the installation of certain packages.
